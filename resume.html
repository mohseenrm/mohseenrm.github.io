I worked with Mohseen on number of Automation Tasks which helped us to get many reports auto generated which use to take number of hours for us by checking details manually. This helped us to check overall health of our Messaging Applications quickly and was a big service improvement as it reduced number of Incidents coming to our team. He is quick with his work and easily adapts new technical skills.
 
Apart from good technical person, he is also a good team player who is always available to help …I highly recommend him!!!
