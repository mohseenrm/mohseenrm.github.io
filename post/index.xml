It is very exciting to welcome home a new dog, but you need to make sure you apartment or house is dog friendly and ready to go before they arrive.
Heres a quick checklist of items for you and my future self to help prepare for a new dog.</description>

      <description>Introduction Heya Folks, wanted to share a few thoughts on which is better code or config for defining features in web apps or in general any application. While it seems like a minor detail, but I strongly feel it affects how well someone can use or extend an application. For that reason, I wanted to share about 7 reasons why you should consider building features using config vs baked in code.</description>

      <description>Welcome folks! Hope 2022 is going to be a great year for all of you. Today I wanted to share my thoughts on Fullstack development, how&amp;rsquo;s its evolved over the years and what the current state of decentralized fullstack development looks like.
Infamous Fullstack developer Whether its for hiring for a new position or someone fresh off a bootcamp wanting to get their hands dirty, a lot of folks gravitate towards Fullstack development.</description>

      <description>Making Promises Functional Hey folks, this is a quick overview on how to make promises functional in fp-ts. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to fp-ts would highly recommend reading the fp-ts guide to get more familiar with the library. Before we delve into why fp-ts, and why promises are a pain to get port onto fp-ts, wanted to first walk through why functional paradigm is a good option in the first place.</description>

      <title>Enabling Airflow API</title>

      <description>Introduction Hey folks, previously I wrote a blog post about how to setup Airflow and how it can streamline data pipelines and a great replacement for cron tasks.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go over how to enable their api to trigger dags through nodes vs manually or scheduled runs.
By default after installing Airflow, the api is disabled for all requests. From Airflow docs, a few apis are experimental and need additional security like basic auth or only accept requests from trusted ips.</description>

      <title>Airflow Cron on Steroids</title>

      <description>Airflow Airflow is a popular open-source framework for running data pipelines, but also really great at running tasks/scripts on a schedule. Cron has supported scheduling tasks for a while, but it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to configure and monitor it correctly. Fortunately for me, Airflow was a lot easier to setup DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) and dependencies needed between tasks.
Overview Airflow has a few key features that make it easy to use:</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello! if you have been using a few public apis that rate limit your requests, this blog post might be able to help you bypass restrictions and help mask your requests using free proxies. Warning, please be aware this uses free proxies for making requests, please use more reliable proxy services or different retry methods before using in a production environment. That being said, hope this helps you if you are being blocked by you location and would need a reliable way to bypass rate limits.</description>

      <description>Introduction Heyo there! with a lot of buzz going around machine learning and deep learning, I wanted to try out using a RNN (Recurrent neural network) model to see how well it can predict the closing price of a cryptocurrency. Machine learning models have gotten really good at modeling real world data, so I wanted to see how well it can do with predicting crypto movements after training it with historical data.</description>
